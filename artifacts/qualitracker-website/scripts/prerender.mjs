// Build-time static prerendering for the 8 real routes.
//
// This is a Vite SPA (React + wouter), not a framework with built-in SSR.
// A full server-rendering migration (Next.js/Remix/etc.) would be a much
// bigger architectural change than this site needs — it has a small, fixed
// set of routes and no per-request dynamic data (every page's content is
// either static copy or illustrative demo data). Build-time prerendering
// via a real headless browser gives every route its own fully-rendered
// static HTML file — correct <title>, meta description, canonical URL,
// Open Graph tags, and JSON-LD structured data baked in — without any of
// that architectural churn. (The same approach popularized by tools like
// react-snap; here it's a small script we own directly.)
//
// Runs after `vite build` (see package.json's `build` script). Requires
// puppeteer (devDependency) — its own Chromium is what actually renders
// each route, so framer-motion, IntersectionObserver, matchMedia, and
// everything else the app relies on behaves exactly as it would for a real
// visitor, unlike a Node-based renderToString approach which would need
// every browser-only API mocked or guarded.

// The site's own 8 real routes — see App.tsx's <Switch>. Kept as a literal
// list rather than derived from App.tsx to avoid this script depending on
// route internals; update both if a route is ever added or removed.
//
// "/" MUST be processed last. vite preview's SPA fallback serves
// dist/public/index.html for any unmatched path, and this script
// overwrites that same file with each route's captured snapshot as it
// goes. A real run of this script found the bug directly: prerendering "/"
// first baked its page-specific JSON-LD (from useStructuredData on the
// homepage) into index.html, and every subsequent route then inherited
// that stale script tag from the fallback shell it loaded — on top of its
// own, correct structured data, since document.head.appendChild has no way
// to know about a script tag that arrived via the static HTML rather than
// its own effect. Processing "/" last means every other route still sees
// the pristine, build-fresh index.html as its fallback shell.
